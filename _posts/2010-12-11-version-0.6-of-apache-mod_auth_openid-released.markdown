Just made another release of the [mod_auth_openid](http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid) Apache module.  There are a number of changes in this release, notably the fact that it is now an actual authentication module (using the ap_hook_check_user_id hook).  This means that rather than using the old ghetto syntax of explicitly enabling the module with a configuration option, you can now just specify that you want an authentication type of openid:

{% highlight ApacheConf %}
AuthType     OpenID
require valid-user
{% endhighlight %}

Additionally, you can now use the typical require syntax to specify certain users as authenticated:

{% highlight ApacheConf %}
require user http://bmuller.myopenid.com
{% endhighlight %}

A number of other bugs were fixed as well.  I'm hoping after a few feature additions to finally be able to release a 1.0 version sometime soon.  The new module version can be [downloaded](http://butterfat.net/releases/mod_auth_openid/mod_auth_openid-0.6.tar.gz) or cloned:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/bmuller/mod_auth_openid.git
cd mod_auth_openid
git checkout -b 0.6
{% endhighlight %}
