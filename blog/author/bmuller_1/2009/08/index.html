        <div class="asset-body">
            Last night my girlfriend and I went to the inner harbor area of Baltimore for their weekly Sunday concert series.&nbsp; The area is primarily frequented by tourists and shoppers; it's generally considered to be the safest area of Baltimore.&nbsp; Halfway through the concert, the couple right in front of us became engaged during, of all things, a Van Morrison song.&nbsp; Shortly after the proposal, and resulting general applause from the rest of the small audience, the couple stood in an embrace and left.<br /><br />Within a few minutes I noticed a young (late teens) male and female running toward the small amphitheater.&nbsp; As they ran up the steps next to me and directly over the spot where the young couple had solidified their marital intent, I heard the female say "Keep moving - you've got to keep moving - that fucker shot you".&nbsp; That's the point at which I noticed the spurting blood coming from the male's arm and landing on my pants.&nbsp; After they ran past, I stood up, and after trying to figure out what it was I just saw, I walked in the direction they were running.&nbsp; I grabbed some gloves from a police officer and assisted another EMT who had just run up in controlling the bleeding (it was an arterial brachial bleed) and treating for shock.&nbsp; It took over 10 minutes for an ambulance to get there (we were a few blocks from two hospitals - no idea why it took so long).&nbsp; After transferring care and a report to the arriving EMTs (and taking a minute to scrub the blood off my body using the cleaning kit from the back of the ambulance) I heard that there was actually another patient that had just been picked up by another EMS unit who was shot by the same assailant.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a police helicopter that was hovering overhead in no time instructing the running crowds to "leave the scene" and threatening to arrest anyone who stayed.&nbsp; In the report later, the police claim that they couldn't find the shooter "because of the chaos that ensued after the shots were fired" (see story <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/dining/bal-md.shooting16aug16,0,5351277.story">here</a>).&nbsp; I imagine that has something to do with the police chasing all of the witnesses away with the threat of arrest.&nbsp; <br /><br />The officers who were there on scene when I got to the patient were fairly useless.&nbsp; It took numerous requests to one officer before she would even stand over me with a flashlight so I could see what I was doing.&nbsp; The other officers simply stood there and refused to assist us in controlling the scene.&nbsp; The female was encouraging the patient to keep running turned out to be his sister.&nbsp; She was literally screaming at us that we needed to get him some water and stop holding his feet down.&nbsp; The officers flatly refused to remove her so that we could work without distraction.&nbsp; <br /><br />This city has a homicide rate that is nearly seven times the national rate, six times the rate of New York City, and three times the rate of Los Angeles.&nbsp; The police commissioner for the city seems to either be oblivious or challenged when it comes to crime statistics.&nbsp; Two months ago he stated that the Inner Harbor and surrounding neighborhoods were safe.&nbsp; That was apparently his assessment after a few teens stabbed each other and there was a string of robberies.&nbsp; Perhaps he'll be a bit slower to make the same statement again.<br /><br />The mayor has just <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-md.ci.indict10jan10,0,2551581.story">been charged</a> with 12 counts of felony theft, perjury, fraud and misconduct in office.&nbsp; The police have no problem shooting a convenience store robber holding nothing but a screwdriver in the head, followed by a pair of paramedics who couldn't tell that he was moving and still alive.&nbsp; They left and went back to their station; the police apparently weren't as dense and figured out that movement likely indicated life and called the medics back (more <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-md.briefs030aug03,0,7945100.story">here</a> and <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-emts0804,0,2910362.story">here</a>).<br /><br />I'm amazed at how it is normal that on the same square foot of ground in this city a young, loving couple can become engaged and then ten minutes later that same spot be covered with the blood of a teenage boy.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/dining/bal-harborshooting-wjzpage,0,2633542.htmlstory">clips from the news</a> seem to make it sound as though this isn't so much of an unusual occurrence in the "safest" area of the city.&nbsp; They seem to say that since the shootings were non-fatal it isn't that bad.&nbsp; I'm not sure I can ever get used to thinking that attempted homicide is somehow better than successful homicide.<br /><br />This city might take some getting used to.<br />

            So, I'm now all moved in to Baltimore.&nbsp; Big city.&nbsp; I won't have inter
tubes until Tuesday night, so in the meantime I'm drinking coffee and
using tubes at a place a block away from my apartment -
<a href="http://www.redemmas.org/">http://www.redemmas.org</a> - which is a commie/anarchist "<a href="http://www.redemmas.org/section/about/collectives/">worker-owned and
collectively-managed</a>" bookstore/coffee shop.&nbsp; The conversational topics
here are amazing, as I'm sure you can imagine.&nbsp; They basically go like:<br /><br /><blockquote>So, dude, like we should, like, totally just stop using money, and,
like, start living on farms and like treating animals with respect.&nbsp;
And everybody should have free healthcare, which we won't really need 'cause there won't be any McDonalds, and, like, college should be free.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Totally dude, down with capitalist pigs and up with real pigs, man,
like they're smart animals, man.&nbsp; I mean, like, society is totally
screwed up, like fuck it, dude.<br /></blockquote>

Of course, I then can only think of retorting in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">Mr. Lebowski</a> style:<br /><blockquote>
Sure!&nbsp; Fuck it!&nbsp; That's your answer!&nbsp; Tattoo it on your forehead!&nbsp;
Your answer to everything!&nbsp; Your "revolution" is over, [smelly hippie]!&nbsp;
Condolences!&nbsp; The bums lost!&nbsp; My advice is, do what your parents did!&nbsp;
Get a job, sir!&nbsp; The bums will always lose-- do you hear me?!<br /></blockquote>
<br />
The coffee isn't bad, though, and the tubes are free.<br />
