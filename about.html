<h1>Finding What?</h1>
<p>
This site has information about the research and activities of me, Brian Muller.  I've been 
vacillating between the areas of computational biology, computer science, and 
data mining for a few years now.  I am, however, always looking for science.
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I currently work at <a href="http://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> as the Director of Data Science, where I write code and do math (sometimes at the same time) in DC/NY.</p>

<p>Before that, I was CTO and Co-founder of <a href="http://opbandit.com">OpBandit, Inc</a> which optimized content on major publishers' sites across 7 countries.  OpBandit was <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fa3f68a0-d957-11e4-a8f1-00144feab7de.html">sold to Vox</a> in April of 2015.

<p>Prior to that, I ran the Data Science, Data Products, and Data Infrastructure teams at <a href="http://livingsocial.com">LivingSocial</a> in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>
Before that I worked for the <a href="http://www.washpostco.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62487&p=irol-landing">

<p>Prior to that I was a research assistant in the 
<a href="http://genomics.jhu.edu">Center for Computational Genomics</a> at <a href="http://www.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a> in Baltimore, MD.
