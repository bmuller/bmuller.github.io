Ham:
"Scientists should not debate creationists" - dawkins foundation
secularists have hijacked the word science
creationists can be great scientists
differentiates between observational and historical science
6K year old earth...

history by definition can't be observational science because you can't see it
scientists can agree on what they see - and agree on how things work - but disagree about things they can't see, i.e. history
it's not a battle over the evidence - it's about world views and starting points
evolution is "an attempt to impose an anti-God religion on generations of unsuspecting students"

"evolutionists don't want to admit there is a belief aspect to what they're saying"

makes a difference between hmself as "observational science bloke" who accepts current science and "historical science bloke" who approaches knowledge in a distinctly different way - *starting now* with a religious text, then using science - as opposed to his other half


*STarts from a point of weakness*:
1) on defensive from start - "earth is young" - which doesn't prove his point, only serves to disprove bill's - bill provides affirmative case, Ken provides only reasons why it couldn't be, not affirmative proof for why the earth was created
2) trots out respectible scientists who agree - looks sad - "look, we're not crazy - these guys who seem perfectly normal all agree with me" - bill has to do no such thing
3) at same time - ken claims that young earth scientists are derrided and marginalized - after showing off his creme de la cremem who publish in nature and invented the mri etc

me:
science is secular, by definition

BUT - the "evidence" and points of argumentation are all around (1) proving young earth and (2) proving there was no evolution of species - WHICH is far from proving a counter point - that there was a creator

Ham finds the point between certainty and hypothesis (we see "orchids" of species, but the idea that there was a tree of species hasn't been observed) and says "ah ha! here is the point between "science" (aka observational science) and the introduction of "belief" - "to indoctrinate students to accept evolutionary belief as observational science"

Nye:
comments on the possible halt of science if multiple views of "science" are accepted
clear that he's not someone with experience arguing - makes sense as a teacher - whereas ham is probably on the defensive a lot holding a minority view
