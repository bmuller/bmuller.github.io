Over the last year, I've traveled to 11 countries (and [1 semi-autonomous region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar)) on 6 out of 7 continents.  I thought it would be fun to pick one picture from each continent and then write a description about each one.  I often send pics like these to The Facebook and The Twitter, but I never add commentary.  Maybe I should, and this is a first (trial) attempt.  So here's Six Pictures from Six Continents, along with a description from what I remember of each:

## Africa

Ten minutes before this photo was taken, I learned three things: (1) we had a flat tire, (2) we were 30 minutes away from the gates being locked in the national park, which would lock us in for the night if we were on the wrong side, and (3) big cats (lions and leopards) were in the park, making a stay overnight less than desireable.  I suppose a fourth thing I learned was that if you go with the one-man tour guide operation driving a rented "soccer mom" mini-van - instead of the more established companies that drive enormous 4 wheel drive tanks (with not one but two full spare tires strapped to the back) - then you've got a much better chance at adventure.

Shortly after first arriving in Arusha, Tanzania for a 3 month stay, my friend and colleague [Dan Mayer](https://www.mayerdan.com) and I decided to check out the neighboring national park.  [Arusha National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arusha_National_Park) is fairly small (around 52 square miles), but it has some pretty varied wildlife.  It entirely covers a dormant volcano, Mount Meru, which is the second highest peak in Tanzania after the famous Mount Kilimanjaro (which may have [one or two peaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46btEgKmCTo) depending on how you look at it).  The national parks require that you go with a registered tour guide - partly for safety reasons (there's plenty in the parks that can kill you) and, I suspect, partly as a jobs program to help the local economy.  As an entrepreneur, I wanted to support other local entrepreneurs and decided to go with a smaller "start-up" operation instead of a much larger tour company.  Dan and I went with a local guide that we already knew from a previous trip to a Maasai village nearby, a "one man" operation (though for this trip he brought a local friend).  He showed up with a soccer mom mini-van when he picked us up.  In contrast, most safari vehicles are heavily reinforced tanks with four wheel drive, two regular tires as spares, and tools (like shovels) attached to the outside of the vehicle "just in case."

We had finished driving around the park (with some tough crawls up steep inclines designed for four-wheel drive vehicles) without incident and had about an hour to go before the gates would be closed (regardless of who was still in the park - apparently they don't mind if you stay the night).  That's when we realized we had a flat tire.  We scoured the back of the mini-van - no spare was found.  We were able to get the flat tire off, and then the plan was to try to roll it to one of the park's mechanical shops down the road and see if we could get it patched before the parked closed and we were locked in.  That's when I took this picture - of our guide and his friend running down the road rolling the flat tire along side.

Thankfully, Tanzanians are as friendly as Canadians, and on our run to the mechanical shed a friendly fellow on his way home on the other side of the mountain stopped and offered us his spare.  We were able to switch the tires out and get to the gates before they shut - and I felt a bit like the last employees to make it onto the boat out of the Jurrasic Park island before the typhoon hit and giant T-Rex shaped lions came out to devour us.
